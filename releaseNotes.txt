With regards to possible concerns about user-generated content, they are specifically addressed in section 6 of the The Crafty Barkeep Terms of Service ( http://www.thecraftybarkeep.com/the-fine-print/ ). The Crafty Barkeep takes lewd profile pictures seriously and has built robust business practices to address this issue. Users are able to report other users from within the app for any reason, and we are able to ban a user from the system or certain features as needed.

The Crafty Barkeep addresses all objectionable content within 24 hours. â€‹

 The Crafty Barkeep doesn't allow users to interact directly beyond accepting follow request. As such, there isn't a way for users to abuse one another if they don`t follow each other. Also, at any time following can be stopped. If a user reports some other abusive behavior, which is essentially impossible, our CA team will remove that user within 24 hours.
